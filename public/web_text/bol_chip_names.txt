	+	Kickstart	- Responsible for holding the core of the Amiga operating system, (loosely consider as the kernel)	
	*~	Linda		- AAA Chip - Provides a line data buffer not found in the old chip set.  Buffers display data on a line by line basis to allow higher effective display bandwidth for higher resolution displays and at the same time permitting a degree of compatibility with old software.
	+	Lisa		- 'AA Denise'  
	*~	Mary		- 'AAA Paula' Replaces the old PAULA chip. Responsible for floppy disk control, audio, uart, interrupt generation, pot, and mouse control.
	*~	Monica		- 'AAA Denise' Graphics Chip (see HCS)  Replaces the old DENISE chip. This chip processes all display data including Sprite information. 
	$	Nathalie	- One of two chips that made up the Hombre chipset	
	$	Nathaniel	- One of two chips that made up the Hombre chipset	
	*	OCS		- Original Chipset
	+	Paula		- Audio, floppy, joystick & interrupt circuitry: Ports and Audio (Portia)
	+	Portia		- Either a very early name for Paula, or a very early version of what eventually became Paula	
	!	RACE		- 'AAA' Ram, AMI, and CPU/Expansion controller.  Is a suggested single chip implementation of the CPU/RAM control device.
	+*	Ramsey		- Ram controller with DMA
	%	Ranger		- A prototype computer that was supposed to be the second generation Amiga chipset prior to ECS.
	!	SAIL		- 'AAA'  Synchronous Amiga Interface with Latch device.  Is a single Chip implementation of the Amiga Chip Controller for use with the AAA Chip bus subsystem defined by the Andrea Chip.
	*	Super DMAC 	- SDMAC (A3000/T) provides DMA and bus interface for integrated WD33C93A SCSI controller. (used w/Ramsey)

Chipsets
---------
	- OCS	  - Original Chip Set			- used in the earliest Commodore Amiga computers and defined the Amiga's graphics and sound capabilities. 
	- RCS	  - Ranger Chipset 			- unreleased prototype. intended to be the second-generation Amiga chipset, prior to ECS
	- ECS	  - Enhanced Chipset			- minor improvements over the original chipset (OCS)  
	- AGA	  - Advanced Graphics Architecture	- third-generation Amiga graphic chipset.  A1200/4000 
	- AAA 	  - Amiga Advanced Architecture	 	- intended for the next-generation Amiga multimedia systems. replaced by Hombre (prototype: Nyx)
	- AA+	  - Advanced Architecture+		- Last classic compatible chipset. They planned to release it in 1994 for low end Amiga computers along with AAA.
	- AA+ Access  - Advanced Architecture+ Access	- adopted by Mick Tinker (Access) next gen AGA but was never completed
	- HCS	- Hombre Chipset			- intended as the basis of its next generation game machine called CD64 and a 3D accelerator PCI card.
